# Native ped traffic V1

This resource creates a shared ambient pedestrian population without
reenabling GTA's unmanaged `CPopulation::AddToPopulation` loop. Production
population starts automatically with the resource and adapts to every eligible
player in dimension/interior 0.

The server first selects one versioned vanilla campaign population state. The
default `post_home_coming` preset starts from the stock 336-zone main.scm
bootstrap, applies the late-story territory distribution, and restores Grove
strength 40 in GAN1 and GAN2 while clearing Ballas there. Every client must
acknowledge the same revision before it may own AI or propose a spawn; stale
profiles and candidates are rejected.

Each ready client keeps GTA's stock zone-ped model residency current. It also reports
GTA's read-only population targets for the current zone, two-hour time bucket,
weekday/weekend state and current rain adjustment. The server applies GTA's
live density multiplier, cull-zone reduction and maximum-ped gate, then
reproduces `FindNewPedType` from the shared live population before requesting a
native civilian, dealer, regional city-cop or exact-gang placement
candidate. GTA still chooses the model from its loaded `pedgrp.dat` entries;
the server validates the result, creates the real MTA ped, and assigns one persistent
syncer. Only that owner runs
`CTaskComplexWanderStandard`; other clients receive the existing compact native
locomotion presentation through normal ped sync.

The shared ped-sync path keeps its normal update interval as the baseline. A
material locomotion mode, speed, or direction change opens a bounded 800 ms
spatial burst at 100 ms, with a 400 ms cooldown and a global limit of 16 peds
per pulse. Vehicle evasions and impacts can opt into that same bounded writer
while their task animation is presented; there is no second high-rate network
lane. Scripted animations remain separate and do not consume this budget.

The first behavior checkpoint also enables GTA's stock pedestrian and parked
vehicle avoidance responses. Every client leases the same `ambient-wander`
profile, but only the current syncer may turn a potential encounter into
`CTaskComplexAvoidOtherPedWhileWandering` or `CTaskComplexWalkRoundCar`;
observers keep collision, ground and animation processing while presenting the
owner's synchronized detour.

The second behavior checkpoint admits GTA's stock gun-aimed-at, gunshot and
damage events on the owner. Ordinary bullet sync already recreates shot, whizz,
health and death processing. A client-observed `aim_weapon` transition, checked
against MTA's synchronized target ray by the server, bridges the shooter-local
aimed-at case to the owner as a real `CEventGunAimedAt`. The target ray alone is
not sufficient because MTA updates it continuously even when the aim control is
released.

Traffic spawns also force fighting style `4` (`STYLE_STANDARD`). MTA scripted
peds are backed by `CPlayerPed` and otherwise inherit the player's grab-kick
style `15`; stock ambient `CPed` uses style `4`. Leaving the wrapper default in
place changes both the combat animations and GTA's raw melee factors before
any synchronization occurs.
Likewise, a hit detected by a non-owner is relayed to the owner. The resource
prefers the real `CEventDamage` created there by MTA's synchronized bullet
replay and injects a behavior-only event only when that native event is absent.
GTA then chooses cower, hands-up, duck, turn, flee or fight from the civilian
model's decision maker. Observers mirror the result through the existing
locomotion and animation-presentation lanes without installing local AI or
applying damage a second time.

Native motorcycle carjacks use the same authenticated authority handoff. GTA
first resolves the attacked occupant and target door on the ambient group
owner. The resource forwards that intent only after validating the owner,
group epoch, motorcycle, occupied seat, world, distance, velocity, nonce and
cadence. The server then reconstructs GTA's occupant rule instead of trusting
the client: the primary target receives `TASK_SIMPLE_BIKE_JACKED`, and a
passenger in seat 1 receives the second task 200 ms later only when the primary
target is the driver. Each real player owner installs its own physical task;
remote `CPlayerPed` wrappers never own the ejection.

The moving-vehicle checkpoint keeps that same authority model. GTA's native
`POTENTIAL_GET_RUN_OVER`, `VEHICLE_COLLISION`, `DAMAGE`, and
`GOT_KNOCKED_OVER_BY_CAR` chain runs only on the current ped syncer. It selects
the stock evasive step or dive, hit-by-car, fall/get-up and post-impact response
from the pedestrian's model profile. Observers receive the chosen transient
animation and its bounded spatial samples without running a competing local
collision response. `VEHICLE_HIT_AND_RUN` is deliberately excluded: it belongs
to the future crime/wanted checkpoint, not victim presentation.

The airborne checkpoint extends the shared native-task presentation to GTA's
`JUMP -> IN_AIR_AND_LAND -> LAND` lifecycle, including a blocked jump or a hard
fall/get-up. The owner publishes GTA's selected clip plus a physical airborne
semantic; observers mirror the animation and spatial samples without creating
their own in-air response. During a handoff in flight, the new owner preserves
the synchronized position and velocity and starts GTA's stock
`CTaskComplexInAirAndLand` at the transferred phase. This avoids depending on
the new client's local `EVENT_IN_AIR` geometry check while leaving GTA in
control of `SIMPLE_IN_AIR -> SIMPLE_LAND`. The exact scanner call is fenced on
observers so they cannot create a competing response.

The climb checkpoint completes that physical branch with GTA's stock
`SIMPLE_CLIMB` task. The owner publishes the selected grab, pull-up or vault
clip together with its climb phase, heading, handhold, world-space contact and
the building, object or vehicle used as its anchor. Observers present that
result without running their own local climb scan. During a handoff, the new
owner resolves the same synchronized anchor and resumes the complex jump chain
at the transferred animation phase; if the anchor is no longer valid, it falls
back through GTA's native in-air/land lifecycle rather than leaving the ped
latched to stale geometry.

The public density profile reserves 46 slots below MTA's 110-ped logical limit
for synchronized traffic drivers and short-lived gameplay actors. Nearby
players share the same on-foot population; isolated players are served by the
round-robin spatial arbiter up to the 64-ped cap. The resource issues at most
one global candidate request every 100 ms. Civilians and dealers are created
singly; resident gangs use GTA's native
two-to-four-member batch.
The server keeps the native float class deficits and the stock gate as separate
values. Retail omits dealers from `ms_nTotalPeds`, so dealers reduce only their
own deficit while still counting against Neon's shared physical ped fence. In
production, GTA's zone/time target is doubled and clamped to 12–20 walkers per
populated area; every family is scaled together so the native civilian, gang,
cop and dealer composition is preserved. The gate is rounded only at its final
integer comparison. A 64 m cell guard of 12 and a 2 m
server separation check are only final abuse/saturation bounds; GTA's path-node
density and collision query still decide normal placement.

Model identity now comes from the checked-in `population_catalog.lua`,
generated from retail `PEDGRP.DAT`, `PEDS.IDE`, `PEDSTATS.DAT`, `PED.DAT` and
the audited 336-zone main.scm bootstrap. Its SHA-256 revision is carried by
world snapshots, profiles and every ambient actor; the server reconstructs
class/type from this catalog instead of trusting client metadata.

Each player owns a local population bubble derived from that client's live GTA
creation and camera-generation multipliers. Civilian/dealer residency ends at
the stock 54.5 multiplier; gangs retain GTA's extra 30 m. Overlapping players share
the same peds and counts, while disjoint players can fill separate bubbles.
A group remains resident when any member is inside any player's gang radius.
Suspended actors must cross back inside GTA's 50.5 multiplier before resuming;
this stock spatial hysteresis prevents repeated task teardown at the outer edge.
Peds beyond every matching radius receive the stock four-second grace, then
the server asks every eligible client whether the element is on screen. A
missing answer or any visible vote defers removal. Family rebalancing uses the
same all-client camera veto and retires at most one surplus ped or whole group
every two seconds.

Before creation, every client close enough to suffer a visible pop evaluates
GTA's native camera-sphere test. Any visible-too-close vote rejects the
candidate. Accepted peds start at alpha zero and fade locally over the stock
roughly 16-frame interval; the server publishes only the initial and final
alpha states. This preserves visual continuity without sending per-frame alpha
updates. The intermediate vanilla 25 m-to-removal-radius camera-mode retention
exceptions are not modeled yet; removal is deliberately more conservative and
waits for every client to report the ped off screen.

Ownership remains sticky while the current owner is a collision resident.
Leaving that residency radius must be continuous for three seconds before a
resident peer takes over. The old owner kills its native task and releases its
streaming lease before the revalidated new epoch is assigned.

Detailed logs and periodic population snapshots are off by default
(`*debug=false` in `meta.xml`). `/pedtraffic debug on|off` persists the choice
across resource restarts. Failures and test verdicts remain visible with debug
off. Ped test harnesses may enable debug; use `/pedtraffic debug off` after
testing to return to quiet operation.

With debug enabled, the server also writes bounded structured records to the
deployed resource's private `@population-server.jsonl`. Its
`neon.ped_traffic.population` schema version 2 correlates profile changes, per-player
target/live/deficit snapshots, requests, native misses, camera votes, spawns,
rejections and removals by request, visibility-check, traffic and group IDs.
The file is reset when `/pedtraffic debug on` begins a new session and stops at
20,000 lines.

## Commands

- `/pedtraffic on` starts population generation.
- `/pedtraffic off` destroys only resource-owned traffic peds.
- `/pedtraffic status` prints counters and the current cap.
- `/pedtraffic demo on|off` controls the 32-ped visual-demo target for this
  resource. When `native-vehicle-traffic` is running, `/trafficdemo on|off`
  controls both resources with one command and pairs it with 16 road vehicles.
- `/pedtraffic debug on|off` controls persistent, bounded client/server telemetry.
- `/pedtraffic preset post_intro|post_cleaning_the_hood|post_green_sabre|post_home_coming`
  changes the authoritative campaign population state. Existing traffic is
  cleared and both clients must acknowledge the new revision before refill.
- `/pedtraffic cap 1..240` changes the global circuit breaker; the default is
  240 so fifteen isolated 16-ped areas can fill while nearby players continue
  sharing one local population.
- `/pedtraffic weapon` gives the caller a pistol for the threat checkpoint.
- `/pedtraffic vehicle [model]` creates one resource-owned player vehicle for
  collision testing (default model 560). It is removed on `off`, quit or stop.
- `/pedtraffic airtest` makes the closest active traffic ped perform a native
  jump; add `handoff` to transfer ownership during the real in-air phase.
- `/pedtraffic climbtest` places a shared road barrier in front of the closest
  active ped and makes it enter GTA's native climb/vault task; add `handoff` to
  transfer ownership while `TASK_SIMPLE_CLIMB` is active. The resource removes
  the temporary barrier on completion, failure, `off` or resource shutdown.
- `/pedtraffic residency` runs the fail-fast two-client collision-residency,
  stable-damage identity, hold, suspension and resumption checkpoint below.
- `/pedtraffic bikejack` requires the two clients to already occupy seats 0
  and 1 of the same stationary motorcycle. It clears only this resource's
  ambient population, spawns a deterministic three-member gang five metres
  ahead (one armed Colt 45 member and two unarmed members), and assigns the
  passenger as its native-AI owner. After the ready message, the driver exits
  and hits the reported unarmed member; the reported armed member is the
  expected jacker. After task 1502 begins, the driver remounts.
  If vanilla selects task 1505, rerun the command; the resource deliberately
  does not override the stock 50/50 fight/flee draw.
- `/pedtraffic dealertest` is a fail-fast two-client harness for the complete
  dealer checkpoint. It requests a real dealer, verifies catalog identity,
  logical type 17, no initial weapon and owner-only WanderStandard, feeds
  repeated real native damage-response stimuli until GTA itself enters
  `TASK_SIMPLE_FIGHT_CTRL`, validates the delayed knife/pistol branch, forces
  one owner handoff without rerolling, exercises a minute growth pass and one
  player-attributed `DealerStrength` decrement, restores its zone fixture, then
  requires cleanup ACKs from both clients. Time, transforms and frozen states
  are restored on PASS, FAIL or cancellation.
- `/pedtraffic coptest` is the two-client ambient-cop locomotion harness. It uses
  a runtime-validated south-LS fixture and the public candidate/traffic
  pipeline, then verifies model 280 and logical type COP,
  nightstick/pistol inventory, slot 0, armor 0, rate 30, accuracy 60,
  the exact owner-only `ambient-cop-safe` task vtable, at least three metres of
  GTA path-node patrol, a native GO_TO branch, a handoff, unchanged wanted on
  both clients, no arrest/pursuit/cop task, and two cleanup acknowledgements.
  Pause, scratch-head, traffic-light and road-cross branches are recorded when
  GTA selects them but are not required for PASS because their occurrence
  depends on native path topology and process-global RNG.
- `/pedtraffic coupletest` creates one deterministic civilian pair for the
  complete atomic-couple runtime checkpoint. The common owner validates both retail walk
  speeds, chooses the faster actor as leader (A wins a tie), and acquires both
  reciprocal `CTaskComplexBeInCouple` tasks as one resource-scoped lease. The
  harness proves leader WanderStandard and follower WalkAlongside, records
  eight one-second locomotion samples before and after a release-before-acquire
  handoff, injects one real `CEventGunAimedAt` and requires the retail
  `BeInCouple` callsite to deliver it to the partner, then moves a surviving
  pair to 10.25 m to exercise retail's strict `>10 m` dissolution. The soak trace includes pair distance, movement states,
  travelled distance and the follower gait seen by the observer. WalkAlongside
  keeps a durable SPRINT-capable parent, but retail downshifts its live
  SimpleGoTo child to WALK below five metres; the harness therefore rejects
  more than one remote RUN/SPRINT grace sample in either owner epoch. It
  requires two clean client acknowledgements. Normal traffic also runs the
  automatic post-civilian producer: the server owns the exact CRT LCG sample,
  takes the branch at `sample15 >= 29491`, requests GTA's two native
  occupations and commits two civilians or zero with a common owner/epoch.

The resource starts enabled. Server staff can stop it with `/pedtraffic off`
before running an isolated harness. V1 is outdoor-only (`dimension=0`,
`interior=0`) and admits GTA's civilian, dealer, regional city-cop and
resident-gang population classes.
Dealers are solo, use the exact retail `DEALERS` group `{28,29,30,254}`, carry
logical `PED_TYPE_DEALER` even when `peds.ide` says criminal/civilian, receive
no initial weapon, and start in WanderStandard. On the first real fight-control
task, their immutable server seed reproduces `m_nRandomSeed & 0x3FF`: below
200 the knife is attempted first and a resident knife model permits the
independent pistol attempt; 200..399 gives the pistol; 400..1023 stays
unarmed. Grants use 50 ammo and the pistol STD stat. Dealer sales remain
deferred. Ambient
vehicle population, wanted/pursuit/arrest police behavior, attractors, conversations,
headless/offline simulation, custom weather rules and public server density
controls remain outside this checkpoint. GTA's stock rain reduction is already
reflected in the native target. The optional command above creates a test
vehicle, not autonomous vehicle traffic. The existing ambient event scopes use
the spawned model's gang identity; persistent gang relations in GTA systems not
covered by those scopes remain a later behavior checkpoint.

## Engine APIs exercised

- `updateAmbientPedPopulationModels(Vector3 origin)` runs GTA's ped-only zone
  model residency pass. Call it while candidate generation is active.
- `getAmbientPedSpawnCandidate(Vector3 origin[, string populationClass,
  int gangId])` returns a read-only table with
  `model`, `pedType`, `populationClass`, `gang`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `direction`,
  and `pathLerp`, or `false` plus a bounded miss reason. It never creates an
  unmanaged GTA ped. Omit the optional arguments for GTA's local automatic
  choice; pass `"civilian", -1`, `"dealer", -1`, `"cop", -1` or `"gang", 0..7` when a
  server has already arbitrated the class from synchronized live counts. A
  forced dealer or gang miss never falls back to a civilian.
- `getAmbientPedPopulationProfile()` returns GTA's current supported target as
  `supportedTarget`, split into `civilianTarget`, `dealerTarget`, `copTarget`
  and `gangTarget`. `rawCopTarget`
  preserves the pre-`noCops` popcycle value for diagnostics. Zone metadata includes
  `zoneLabel`, `zoneType`, `dealerStrength`, `raceFlags`, `noCops`, `timeIndex`,
  `weekend`, and the ten native `gangWeights`. Runtime density/lifecycle fields expose
  `pedDensityMultiplier`, `fewerPedsMultiplier`, `maximumPedsInUse`,
  `creationDistanceMultiplier` and `generationDistanceMultiplier`. The
  civilian target already contains GTA's stock rain adjustment.
- `isAmbientPedSphereVisible(Vector3 position[, float radius])` performs GTA's
  camera-frustum sphere query without creating an entity. This resource uses
  it only as a multi-client candidate veto; every near-enough camera must agree
  before the server creates a shared ped.
- `resetAmbientPedPopulationZonesToBootstrap()` restores the stock main.scm
  population initialization inside the active reversible lease.
- `setAmbientPedPopulationZoneState(label, state)` applies validated optional
  `populationType`, `races`, `dealerStrength`, `noCops`, and indexed
  `gangStrengths` fields to one INFO zone. The harness uses it only while
  applying a server-issued world revision.
- `resetAmbientPedPopulationModels()` releases the eight stock civilian slots,
  the single retail dealer slot and the ped-only gang residency, then restores
  the zone metadata snapshot.
  Call it when generation stops; the client script also calls it during
  resource shutdown.
- `acquirePedNativeEventProfile(ped, "ambient-wander")` leases the narrow
  avoidance and civilian-threat policy. Acquire it on every client and release
  the token on element or resource teardown; only the current syncer reports
  the lease as active.
- `addPedNativeGunAimedAtEvent(ped, aimingPed, token)` inserts GTA's real aimed-at
  event for the active ambient owner. The profile token fences this cross-owner
  bridge against observers and unrelated resources.
- `addPedNativeDamageResponseEvent(ped, attacker, weapon, bodypart, token)`
  inserts a behavior-only GTA damage event on the active owner. MTA keeps the
  physical hit and health pipeline; the replay only selects the model's stock
  flee or fight response and cannot apply the damage twice.
- `addPedNativeDamageEvent(localPlayer, attacker, weapon, bodypart,
  damageFactor, direction, token)` replays an authenticated cross-owner hit on
  the victim client. `damageFactor` is GTA's raw pre-calculator melee value,
  exposed as the fifth `onClientPlayerDamage`/`onClientPedDamage` argument;
  the sixth argument is GTA's `0..3` local hit direction. The victim runs the
  stock damage-response calculator against its own health, armour and ped
  state before the event enters GTA's event group. The primitive accepts only
  the local player and an attacker covered by the calling resource's observer
  lease; the server must still validate owner, epoch, weapon, distance,
  cadence and the allowed factor range. Damage events created outside
  `CWeapon::GenerateDamageEvent` expose `damageFactor = -1`; callers must not
  infer or invent a factor from the final `loss` value.
- `onClientPlayerNativeDamageAttempt` exposes that raw factor and direction
  once for the original GTA damage event, before MTA's health-delta gate. This
  matters when native AI hits a remote player: the AI owner can simulate the
  contact while only the victim owner may change health. The event is
  observational; this resource authenticates and relays it before invoking
  `addPedNativeDamageEvent` on the victim client.
- `onClientPedNativeBikeJackAttempt`, sourced from the ambient jacker, exposes
  the already-resolved target player, motorcycle, target door and optional
  passenger before GTA can assign physical tasks to remote wrappers. The owner
  sends only this intent; the server recomputes the canonical recipients.
- `addPedNativeBikeJackTask(victim, jacker, vehicle, door, draggedDownTime,
  primaryVictim, token)` installs GTA's exact `TASK_SIMPLE_BIKE_JACKED` on the
  local player after a validated forward. The observer lease, current vehicle
  and seat still gate the binding locally so a delayed owner packet cannot
  eject a player from a different state.

All population and behavior functions are client-side primitives. The server must still validate
the proposal, create and own the MTA ped, select exactly one syncer, and clean
up every resource-owned element.

With debug telemetry enabled, a successful two-occupant carjack produces
`native_bike_jack_owner_attempt`, two
`native_bike_jack_server_forward` records, two
`native_bike_jack_victim_result` records with `accepted=true`, and one
`native_bike_jack_bridge_complete` with `success=true`. The dedicated command
then waits until both players report outside the motorcycle and both server
seat slots are empty. Only `native_bike_jack_test_seat_converged` with all four
booleans true permits `native_bike_jack_test_result` (`outcome=PASS`).
Rejections are fail-closed and recorded as `native_bike_jack_rejected`; a
missing victim ACK terminates as `receipt-timeout`, while accepted tasks that
do not clear both seats terminate as `seat-convergence-timeout`.

## First two-client run

1. Put both players outdoors in the same neighbourhood and run
   `/pedtraffic debug on`, then `/pedtraffic on`.
2. At Grove Street, confirm native Grove-family models can appear; repeat in a
   Ballas neighbourhood and confirm the resident gang family changes. Both
   clients should see the same models, population classes and positions; only
   `[ped-traffic][client] accepted` owners run AI. The native target may keep
   the nearby count below 12 for the current zone/time profile.
3. Stand or walk in front of several traffic peds, then observe peds passing a
   parked vehicle. `avoid-transition` must show the response only with
   `role=owner`; both clients should see the same walking detour without a run
   transition or correction snap.
4. Walk the clients to opposite sides of a ped. A handoff should log one
   `revoke`, one `released` transition and a higher assignment epoch, without a
   teleport or duplicate ped.
5. Disconnect the current owner. A nearby second client should receive the next
   epoch; with no nearby fallback, the server should despawn that ped.
6. Kill one traffic ped and verify its corpse is removed after 30 seconds
   and replenished within the cap.
7. Run `/pedtraffic status`, then `/pedtraffic off`. The server must report zero
   resource-owned peds and each client must release its eight stock zone-model
   slots. No vehicle may be created at any point.

## Deterministic collision-residency checkpoint

Connect exactly two clients on foot in dimension/interior 0, enable traffic,
and wait until one grounded native gang group is active. Run this command from
either client:

```text
/pedtraffic residency
```

The harness enables and resets the population JSONL trace, preserves both
player transforms, then drives one existing group through the shortest causal
sequence: one damage identity and decision, owner A and resident B near the
group, A outside its residency radius for an A-to-B handoff, the inverse
B-to-A handoff, a short no-resident interval of 1.5 seconds which must preserve
the owner, epoch and native group, then a continuous three-second absence which
may enter `suspended`, and finally A returning for resumption. The original
damage context is never reinjected after either technical transition. Before
each real release, the outgoing owner reports GTA's live weapon/ammo snapshot;
the server accepts only the canonical weapon with non-increasing total ammo and
a clip within the audited capacity, then publishes that state to the next
owner. This prevents both ammo resurrection and client-minted ammo. Player
transforms and frozen states are restored on PASS, FAIL, cancellation, or a
client departure.

Every 100 ms, `@population-server.jsonl` correlates the scenario action and
elapsed tick with group owner/epoch/state and each ped's Z/frozen state. Both
clients add their local Z, vertical velocity, grounded/syncer/collision-ready
flags, and physical task phase. The scenario stops at the first Z drop greater
than 0.5, `IN_AIR`/fall task, active-owner sample without collision readiness,
acceptance without the readiness proof, owner/epoch change during the short
hold, suspension before three seconds, duplicate damage dispatch, missing
frozen suspension, missing client, or seven-second phase timeout. A successful
terminal row is `residency_test_result` with `result=PASS`; the offline analyzer
also requires two hold starts, one short-hold release, one long-hold expiry,
one damage dispatch, no technical restore for that `damage_id`, and three
bounded weapon-state commits for the two handoffs plus the real suspension.

## Deterministic dealer checkpoint

Connect exactly two clients alive and on foot, then run from either client:

```text
/pedtraffic dealertest
```

The command enables debug/traffic when needed and resets
`@population-server.jsonl`. No manual search for a dealer is required. A PASS
contains one `spawn` with `population_class=dealer`, `logical_ped_type=17`,
`initial_weapon=0` and `task_profile=wander-standard`; one
`dealer_fight_weapon_committed` matching its seed and knife-model residency;
one `dealer_test_growth_roll`; one applied `dealer_strength_death`; six
`dealer_test_sample` rows covering both clients before combat, after combat and
after the handoff; two accepted `dealer_test_cleanup_ack` rows; and a final
`dealer_test_result` with `result=PASS`.

The clients are placed at the validated Grove Street fixture and remain
unfrozen while GTA converges a fresh popcycle profile after the test teleport.
They are frozen only after the dealer is active, so the native profile producer
can settle without making the authority and handoff samples dependent on
player movement. Their original transforms and frozen states are restored on
every terminal path.

Population model residence is refreshed both per rendered frame and by the
one-second profile timer. This keeps a minimized or unfocused second client
eligible for the two-client profile and authority assertions even when MTA
throttles `onClientPreRender` for that window.

A `DealerStrength` revision fences new admission while clients apply the new
zone snapshot, but it does not invalidate already resident traffic during the
bounded ACK window. The dealer harness traverses this same runtime guard and
also requires a live combat context to be restored after its forced owner
handoff; a return to `WanderStandard` is not accepted as continuity.

Run the analyzer with:

```text
python3 utils/native-ai-trace-analyzer.py \
  --population path/to/@population-server.jsonl
```

The owner sample must be the only one with syncer, accepted assignment and an
active native profile. It owns WanderStandard initially, then a live combat
task in both the combat and post-handoff samples. The observer still holds the
passive profile lease but must not own an assignment or active native AI. The
epoch advances exactly once during the forced handoff.

## Population world-state checkpoint

1. Enable debug and traffic at Grove Street. Both clients must log the same
   `population-world-ready` revision before the first candidate request.
2. With `post_intro`, GAN1/GAN2 must report Grove strength 10. Switch to
   `post_cleaning_the_hood`; existing traffic is cleared and the new revision
   must report Grove 40 on both clients.
3. Switch to `post_green_sabre`; GAN1/GAN2 become Ballas 10/25 and Grove 0.
   Switch to `post_home_coming`; both become Grove 40 and Ballas 0.
4. During every switch, no profile or candidate carrying the previous revision
   may be accepted. `/pedtraffic status` and periodic debug telemetry must show
   the same preset and revision.

## Population arbitration and model-diversity checkpoint

1. Put both clients together at Grove Street, run `/pedtraffic debug on`,
   `/pedtraffic preset post_cleaning_the_hood`, then `/pedtraffic on`.
2. Server `spawn` lines must show the floating civilian/dealer/gang targets, live
   counts, randomized sub-two deficits, chosen gang score and native model.
   There must be no `population-hint-mismatch` and no old
   `population-class-quota` rejection storm.
3. Let the population refill repeatedly for at least 30–60 gang creations.
   Telemetry `models=` must contain only Grove models 105/106/107 for gang 1;
   all three should appear over the stock two-model residency rotation. A short
   run may legitimately repeat one skin because vanilla loads only two gang
   models at once and shuffles only the loaded entries.
4. Repeat in Ballas territory and confirm models 102/103/104 over time. Repeat
   once in SF or LV to verify the regional `pedgrp.dat` column is used instead
   of the Los Santos column. Both clients must see the same server-created
   elements and models throughout.

## Vanilla density and lifecycle checkpoint

1. Start both clients together at Grove Street, enable debug, select
   `post_cleaning_the_hood`, then enable traffic. Do not move for 30 seconds.
   `population_snapshot` rows must converge to the reported hard total without
   repeated `cell-full`, `separation` or `visibility-timeout` failures.
2. Face the same street from both clients while it fills. A candidate visible
   too close to either camera must produce `visible-to-resident`, not a spawn.
   Accepted visible-ring candidates should fade in, never appear fully opaque
   in one frame.
3. Move the clients together through Ganton. Nearby counts should refill
   continuously in small batches; old peds must remain until outside the
   class-specific radius for four seconds and off screen on both clients.
4. Separate the clients into disjoint Los Santos neighbourhoods. Each local
   bubble should approach its own native target without the five-group limit
   being shared between client owners. Bring the clients back together and
   confirm overlapping counts merge without duplicate bursts or visible mass
   removal.
5. Leave one client watching an old street while the other moves away. No ped
   visible to the stationary client may despawn. Close that camera or leave the
   area and verify the deferred removals complete, then inspect
   `@population-server.jsonl` for the complete target/request/vote/lifecycle
   chain.
6. Repeat the streaming boundary in both ownership directions: first move only
   the observer away and return, then move only the current owner away while
   the observer stays beside the group. The second case must emit
   `group_handoff_started` with `group-owner-left-residency`, advance the epoch
   exactly once, and never serialize an airborne or descending transform from
   the departing owner. Finally repeat with both clients leaving and with the
   owner disconnecting. A compile or static review is only a test-ready gate;
   this four-case matrix must pass before the lifecycle fix is called complete.

## Threat checkpoint

1. Run `/pedtraffic weapon` on each client in turn.
2. Aim at a traffic ped without firing. If the shooter is not the owner, the
   server and owner log one `gun-aim-bridge`; only the owner logs an active
   `threat-transition`, while both clients see the same stock response.
3. Fire beside several peds, then fire a line within two metres of one without
   hitting it. GTA may choose turn, duck, hands-up, cower or flee from the
   model's decision maker; event 49 normally has no separate civilian response,
   so the nearby event 15 is expected to dominate.
4. Aim until a civilian raises its hands, then inflict one non-lethal shot. The
   observer and server must log one `damage-bridge`; the owner normally logs
   `skipped=local-native`, or `accepted=true` when the fallback was necessary.
   It must then log `damage-transition` followed by GTA's model-dependent flee
   or fight response instead of resuming the aimed-at task's slow walk. The
   observer logs the health change but no native threat task of its own.
5. Repeat from the other client and force a handoff during an active response.
   The old owner must return to `state=none`; the observer must never report a
   native threat task, correction snap or duplicate damage.

## Moving-vehicle checkpoint

1. Enable debug traffic, wait for nearby pedestrians, then run
   `/pedtraffic vehicle` on CL1.
2. Approach a ped without touching it at low and medium speed. The owner alone
   should log `vehicle-transition`; both clients should show the same native
   step, dive, gesture or unchanged response selected by GTA.
3. Repeat with a light bump and a harder non-lethal impact. Compare the initial
   force, fall, ground pose, get-up and subsequent flee or attack. Vanilla does
   not guarantee a flee after every impact.
4. Repeat after choosing a ped owned by CL2 so the vehicle driver and ped owner
   differ. This is the required cross-owner case; record whether either client
   reports damage without the owner reporting the matching native response.
5. Test a frontal approach, a side impact and a ped briefly carried onto the
   bonnet or trapped under the vehicle. Then force an ownership handoff during
   a dive or fall/get-up transition.
6. Run the same matrix from CL2, then `/pedtraffic off`. No observer should
   retain a native vehicle-response task, animation or residual velocity.

Current boundaries for this checkpoint are explicit. GTA's rare
`VEHICLE_COLLISION -> JUMP -> IN_AIR_AND_LAND` branch now uses the shared
airborne presentation, while the remote driver's horn-only gesture is not
bridged. Climbing uses the same owner-only physical presentation and transfers
its synchronized world anchor during a handoff. Car-impact fall/get-up is
cleared narrowly on the old owner during a handoff; bullet, explosion and
unrelated physical-response tasks are preserved.

## Airborne lifecycle checkpoint

1. Keep both clients near the same active traffic ped and run
   `/pedtraffic airtest`. Compare launch, glide, landing, position and velocity.
2. Repeat with `/pedtraffic airtest handoff`. The server transfers the ped only
   after its owner reports the real `TASK_SIMPLE_IN_AIR` phase.
3. Repeat from each client so both ownership directions are covered. The old
   owner must stop integrating the jump, the new owner must finish through
   GTA's native in-air/landing chain, and observers must never create a second
   airborne task.
4. Watch for a double launch, upright frame in mid-air, landing teleport,
   residual vertical velocity or Wander restarting before ground contact.

`setPedJump(ped [, allowClimb = true])` is the reusable owner-side primitive
used by this deterministic test. The harness passes `false` so a nearby ledge
cannot turn the baseline into the separate climb lifecycle.

## Climb/vault lifecycle checkpoint

1. Stand on flat outdoor ground with both clients close together, enable debug
   traffic, and wait for an active ped within 30 metres.
2. Run `/pedtraffic climbtest`. The harness moves that ped in front of one
   resource-owned road barrier, then dispatches `setPedJump(ped, true)` on its
   owner. Both clients should see the same launch, grab/vault, pull-up and
   recovery without a duplicate local climb.
3. Repeat with `/pedtraffic climbtest handoff`. The server transfers ownership
   only after the old owner reports the real `TASK_SIMPLE_CLIMB` phase. The new
   owner must remain attached to the same barrier and complete the jump chain
   without a position, heading or animation reset.
4. Repeat in both ownership directions. Logs should contain `launch`, `climb`
   and the subsequent native phase (`in_air`, `land` or completion); a blocked
   attempt is reported as `blocked`, and a test that never reaches climb fails
   explicitly with `climb-not-entered`. Completion follows the stable removal
   of GTA's jump task chain rather than `isPedOnGround`, which remains false on
   some network objects even after a successful pull-up.
5. Run `/pedtraffic off` during a prepared or active climb and confirm that the
   temporary barrier and traffic ped are both removed.

## Production telemetry

The server log emits a `[ped-traffic][production]` population snapshot every
15 seconds. It includes profile freshness and native targets per player, nearby
live class counts, global and ped-pool pressure, serialized candidate/visibility
work, and rejection/miss deltas. The per-player `reason` distinguishes world
convergence, missing/stale profiles, target completion, capacity pressure and a
ready or busy candidate lane. Profile changes are also logged immediately.

## Checkpoint evidence

The V1 was built as `Release|Win32` for the affected client projects and
checked in game with two clients in Los Santos and Las Venturas. Two forced
owner departures produced 23 successful epoch changes with zero client task
failures. The observing client retained the same walking presentation and the
second run showed no visible freeze, teleport, disappearance, or walk-to-run
transition. Resource restart and last-player departure also returned the
resource-owned population to zero.

The later behavior run checked one cross-owner aim, non-lethal damage,
hands-up interruption, physical reaction, recovery, flee, parked-vehicle
avoidance, and surrounding panic with two clients. The synchronized ped matched
the owner's straight-line sprint speed and the burst budget never deferred a
candidate. Complex collision turns can still diverge transiently by roughly
one to two metres before reconverging because each client reaches the local
collision on a different frame. Both clients then quit cleanly and the server
returned `spawned=191`, `despawned=191`, and `active=0` without a sync or script
error.

The moving-vehicle run confirmed owner-only native evasive steps, dives,
impact falls and get-up presentation across two clients, including bounded
spatial bursts during abrupt collision detours. The final airborne regression
then alternated three forced in-flight handoffs between both clients. All three
completed without a timeout, script error, crash or observer-side native task;
two explicitly recorded the new owner's complete `IN_AIR -> LAND` chain. The
third reached the ground before the next 50 ms diagnostic sample and completed
without a residual task or velocity.

The climb regression then completed both the uninterrupted and forced-handoff
barrier cases on two clients. Observers received the native climb animation
through completion, while the new owner reconstructed `TASK_SIMPLE_CLIMB` on
the same barrier and finished without a timeout, task failure or crash.

## Deferred vanilla-reference validation

Before declaring broad traffic parity complete, record a small reference suite
directly in unmodified GTA:SA single-player using telemetry equivalent to the
Neon owner diagnostics. Cover at least pedestrian pursuit, melee combat and
blocking, threat/flee reactions, ambient gang groups, obstacle and moving-
vehicle avoidance, impacts, airborne recovery, and climbing. Keep the world
location, models, weapons, time, weather, target geometry, and random seed as
stable as practical, and preserve each run as a versioned session bundle.

Compare those reference captures against the Neon owner first, then compare
the owner against both multiplayer observers. The report should align native
task transitions, active animation associations and progress, movement state,
position, velocity, heading, and reaction timing for each ped. This final
differential pass is deliberately deferred until the behavior checkpoints are
implemented; it should replace subjective visual expectations or reliance on
reversed source alone when deciding whether a remaining difference is vanilla
behavior, a native-wrapper mismatch, or a synchronization defect.
